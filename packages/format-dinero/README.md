# @soldi/format-dinero

This package offers an extension to Soldi with the Dinero v1
toFormat() implementation.

It is used by `@soldi/dinero` to give a format implementation which
matches the Dinero v1 API exactly.

The code for this extension is entirely lifted from the Dinero v1
implementation, and as such, is subject to the LICENSE.dinero.md
located in this repository.

For documentation on the toFormat() function please see the
[documentation for Dinero v1](https://dinerojs.com/module-dinero).
